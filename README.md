# Responsive-Porfolio

This Project I had limited time. To start off I used a Bootstrap Nav bar and took the contents I needed.  After that I added containers to each linked page. On the contacts page I added a form and took the parts that I needed.  For the portfolio page I added responsive images of 4 social media pages (I don't have any social media so the links take you to the main page). I would have added more detail to this project if I had more time.  I commented on a few sections to explain what I did.
